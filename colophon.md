# Colophon

A colophon describes the methods, tools, and materials used to make a creative work. Traditionally, colophons were included as the ending flourish of making a book. This is our colophon for how we produce {{ site.name }}.

## History

This version of the site was produced in May 2019, beginning as a reference implementation of the [Chicago Design System](http://chicagodesignsystem.org/). Highlights include a new brand and visual language and a more [accessible experience for Chicagoans](/accessibility). It was produced to support a consistent and predictable user experience across all our applications and services.

## Technology

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It is produced using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a blog-aware static site generator written in Ruby. Jekyll can generate a static web site from text content stored in markdown files and a theme, in this case the Chicago Design System.

The Chicago Design System code is forked, or built upon, the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) ([View the USDS code on GitHub](https://github.com/uswds/uswds)).

Learn more about the City of Chicago's source code for the [Chicago Design System](http://chicagodesignsystem.org/) and other projects at our [GitHub profile](https://github.com/Chicago).

## Design & imagery

The Chicago Design System theme was developed in pro bono partnership with [Ogilvy](https://ogilvy.com/), and type designer Patric King of [House of Pretty](https://xo.houseofpretty.com). Typefaces Big Shoulders (coming soon!), [Saira](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Saira), [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), and [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) are hosted on Google fonts 

Many of the images appearing on City of Chicago websites are a product of the Department of Fleet and Facility Management's <a href="https://chicago.gov/content/city/en/depts/dgs/provdrs/asset_management.html" target="_self" title="Bureau of Asset Management">Bureau of Asset Management</a>.

Prints are available to buy online at the [Chicago Image Gallery](https://chicagoimagegallery.cityofchicago.org/).
