The City of Chicago is committed to making information and services accessible to residents, businesses and visitors through digital products like {{ site.name }}. It is our goal to provide a welcoming and helpful experience.

## What are we doing?

To help us make {{ site.name }} a positive place for everyone, the City of Chicago uses the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.

The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We’ve chosen Level AA as the target for {{ site.name }}.

## How are we doing?

We've worked hard on {{ site.name }} and believe we've achieved our goal of Level AA accessibility. We monitor the website regularly to maintain this, but if you do find any problems, please get in touch.

## Let us know what you think

If you enjoyed using {{ site.name }}, or if you had trouble with any part of it, please get in touch. We'd like to hear from you in any of the following ways:
