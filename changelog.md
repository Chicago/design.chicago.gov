Oh, yeah, [GitHub Bootstrap Chicago Design System Theme](https://github.com/Chicago/design-cds-bootstrap/projects/1), baby! Coming to a theater near you!

### October

#### 2019-10-25 Friday

Lots of conversations about accessibility and budgeting, most of them depressing but informative. Given our resource constraints, we will need to really focus and work with our teams, departments, and vendors to ensure digital accessibility consistently.

Also, we're going to trash the work we've done in establishing USWDS 1.0 as our baseline, and move to a Bootstrap 4 theme. More on that once I blog more for realz.

#### 2019-10-18 Friday

Read like 700 pages of RFP responses, nearly died.
Made a movie about how much we like Frontify.
Used Frontify to distribute a bunch of brand assets.
Took a vacation.
 
#### 2019-10-11 Friday

Production, production, production, production. production.
This website is chuggin' along!

#### 2019-10-04 Friday

Happy Octember, when it still kinda feels like summer, but winter's sharp teeth catch you at the start of end of the day. Anyway, last week was an "exciting" week of trimming budgets and managing expectations, two keys for government work.

Refinement of color profiles as we begin shipping items from the [Chicago Design System](https://design.chicago.gov/), and writing up lots of how to and launch notes. Exciting times. Who knew distributing fonts via remote updates could be so exciting?

Also, lots of planning for rollout. Lots. And lots. Of scribbles on napkins.

### September

#### 2019-09-27 Friday

* We bid our lovely and talented intern Abigal Lammers and our September work adieu as we update the changelog for a last time in September and the first time this fall.

  What did we do? Corrected, refresh, and refined content and display of design.chicago.gov, including a new card-driven home page and card style, and lots of color correcting, re-correcting, and over correcting. It has now been corrected.

  ![This image shows a meme of the crazy butler character from the Shining, who tells a dramatic and terrifying story of correcting his children. The image says, "I corrected all the thinbgs." It contains a misspelling of "things." That's the joke.](/assets/img/memes/corrected.png)

#### 2019-09-20 Friday

* Launched design.chicago.gov, including messing around with DNS changes, Jekyll configuration settings, and all other kinds of gross code. Ew!


#### 2019-09-13 Friday

* Round 90 of the payment calculator. Now it's a web page. Soon it will explain many things about the Mayor's new payment plan.
* Design System, Design System, Design System.
* Census 2020 support.

#### 2019-09-06 Friday

* Accessibility test on the policy & procedures portal intranet. Ouch! Back to the drawing board on parts of this one, with an upgrade or change coming. Thanks to Claudia & Peter from [Great Lakes ADA Center](http://www.adagreatlakes.org/) for the assist in testing!
* That payment calculator isn't going anywhere.
* New & exciting upcoming collaborations with DePaul University.
* Secret design stuff.

### August
